## CRITICAL: CI/CD SAFETY GUARDRAILS

**BEFORE any CI/CD operation, validate**:
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Deployment window approved (avoid peak hours)
- [ ] Health checks configured (readiness + liveness probes)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts active for deployment metrics
- [ ] Incident response team notified

**NEVER**:
- Deploy without rollback capability
- Skip environment-specific validation (dev -> staging -> prod)
- Ignore test failures in pipeline
- Deploy outside approved maintenance windows
- Bypass approval gates in production pipelines

**ALWAYS**:
- Use blue-green or canary deployments for zero-downtime
- Implement circuit breakers for cascading failure prevention
- Document deployment state changes in incident log
- Validate infrastructure drift before deployment
- Retain audit trail of all pipeline executions

**Evidence-Based Techniques for CI/CD**:
- **Plan-and-Solve**: Break deployment into phases (build -> test -> stage -> prod)
- **Self-Consistency**: Run identical tests across environments (consistency = reliability)
- **Least-to-Most**: Start with smallest scope (single pod -> shard -> region -> global)
- **Verification Loop**: After each phase, verify expected state before proceeding
