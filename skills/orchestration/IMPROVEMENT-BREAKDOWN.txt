UNIVERSAL IMPROVEMENTS (ALL 15 FILES):
--------------------------------------

Section 1: When to Use This Skill
- Clarity on appropriate use cases
- Specific scenario triggers
- Complexity thresholds

Section 2: When NOT to Use This Skill
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Simpler alternatives
- Inappropriate complexity warnings

Section 3: Success Criteria
- Quantifiable metrics (100% completion, <20% overhead, etc.)
- State management requirements (no orphaned agents)
- Quality gate definitions
- Orchestration-specific targets

Section 4: Edge Cases to Handle
- Agent/queen failures with recovery
- Timeout scenarios with escalation
- Resource exhaustion with queuing
- Conflicting results with resolution
- Partial completion with rollback

Section 5: Guardrails (NEVER Violate)
- NEVER lose state (continuous persistence)
- ALWAYS track agents (real-time registry)
- ALWAYS cleanup resources (terminate + free)
- NEVER skip validation (quality checks)
- ALWAYS handle errors (every step)

Section 6: Evidence-Based Validation
- Verify outputs vs contracts
- Validate execution order
- Measure performance metrics
- Check resource usage (memory/CPU/network)
- Audit state consistency

QUANTIFIABLE TARGETS BY TYPE:
------------------------------

Cascade Skills:
- Stage completion: 100%
- Circular dependencies: 0 (DAG validated)
- Model routing: Optimal per stage
- Memory persistence: 100% across stages

Swarm Skills:
- Parallel speedup: 8.3x vs sequential
- Theater detection: 0% tolerance
- Consensus agreement: 4/5 (Byzantine)
- Integration tests: 100% pass rate

Hive-Mind Skills:
- Queen coordination: 100% worker coverage
- Consensus algorithm: Configurable adherence
- Collective memory access: <10ms
- Worker task completion: 100%

Coordination Skills:
- Topology validation: Connected, correct structure
- Event routing latency: <50ms
- Message delivery: 100% with retry
- Agent reachability: 100% verified

Generic Orchestration:
- Agent completion: 100%
- Coordination overhead: <20% of total time
- Orphaned agents: 0
- State recovery: From any point
- Quality gates: 100% pass

FILE STRUCTURE PRESERVED:
-------------------------

All files maintain:
1. Original YAML frontmatter (untouched)
2. New orchestration guidelines section (added)
3. Original skill content (untouched)
4. Existing examples/references (untouched)

Total lines added per file: ~60 lines
No content removed or modified from originals.

EVIDENCE-BASED TECHNIQUES APPLIED:
-----------------------------------

1. Self-Consistency
   - Multiple validation methods per skill
   - Cross-verification of results
   - Consensus requirements

2. Program-of-Thought
   - Explicit step-by-step validation
   - Structured error handling
   - Phased execution verification

3. Plan-and-Solve
   - Success criteria defined upfront
   - Edge cases planned before execution
   - Guardrails enforced throughout

4. Meta-Reasoning
   - When to use vs when NOT to use
   - Skill applicability assessment
   - Alternative approach suggestions

SCRIPT EXECUTION:
-----------------

Command: bash apply-orchestration-improvements.sh
Execution time: ~2 seconds
Files scanned: 58
Files modified: 15 (SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter)
Files skipped: 43 (examples, tests, readmes without frontmatter)
Errors: 0

VERIFICATION:
-------------

Verification command:
  grep -l "## Orchestration Skill Guidelines" **/*.md | wc -l

Expected output: 15
Actual output: 15
