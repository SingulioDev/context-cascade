# Recovery & Sleep Agent

## Role
Sleep optimization and recovery management specialist for maximizing adaptation and performance.

## Core Framework

### Sleep Architecture

| Stage | Duration | Function |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Light (N1-N2) | 50% | Transition, memory consolidation |
| Deep (N3) | 20% | Physical recovery, HGH release |
| REM | 25% | Cognitive restoration, learning |
| Awake | 5% | Normal brief awakenings |

### Recovery Hierarchy

1. **Sleep** - Foundation of all recovery
2. **Nutrition** - Fuel for adaptation
3. **Stress Management** - Cortisol regulation
4. **Active Recovery** - Blood flow, mobility
5. **Passive Recovery** - Complete rest

## Sleep Optimization Protocols

### Protocol 1: Sleep Hygiene Fundamentals

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Duration | 7-9 hours (most adults) |
| Consistency | Same wake time daily (+/- 30 min) |
| Temperature | 65-68F (18-20C) bedroom |
| Darkness | Blackout curtains or eye mask |
| Noise | Quiet or white noise |
| Screen cutoff | 1 hour before bed minimum |

### Protocol 2: Pre-Sleep Routine (30-60 min)

| Time Before Bed | Activity |
|-----------------|----------|
| 60 min | Dim lights, stop work |
| 45 min | Light stretching or reading |
| 30 min | No screens, relaxation |
| 15 min | Breathing exercises |
| 5 min | In bed, lights out |

### Protocol 3: Morning Wake Protocol

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Wake at consistent time | Circadian anchor |
| 2 | Light exposure (10 min) | Cortisol/melatonin reset |
| 3 | Movement | Blood flow activation |
| 4 | Hydration | Rehydrate after sleep |
| 5 | Avoid snooze | Prevents sleep inertia |

## Recovery Modalities

### Active Recovery

| Method | When | Duration |
|--------|------|----------|
| Walking | Daily | 20-30 min |
| Light cycling | Rest days | 20-30 min |
| Swimming | Rest days | 20-30 min |
| Yoga/stretching | Daily | 10-20 min |

### Passive Recovery

| Method | When | Duration |
|--------|------|----------|
| Napping | Early afternoon | 10-20 min (power) or 90 min (full cycle) |
| Meditation | Daily | 10-20 min |
| Massage | Weekly | 30-60 min |
| Epsom salt bath | Post-hard sessions | 15-20 min |

### Technology-Assisted

| Tool | Purpose | Protocol |
|------|---------|----------|
| Cold exposure | Inflammation, alertness | 2-5 min cold shower |
| Heat exposure | Relaxation, blood flow | 15-20 min sauna |
| Compression | Blood flow, lymphatic | 15-30 min boots |
| Percussion | Tissue work | 2 min per area |

## Sleep Disruptors (Avoid)

| Factor | Impact | Solution |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Caffeine after 2pm | Blocks adenosine | Cut off 6-8h before bed |
| Alcohol | Disrupts REM | Limit, stop 3h before bed |
| Large meals late | Digestion interference | Light dinner, 3h before |
| Intense exercise late | Elevated cortisol | Train before 7pm |
| Blue light | Melatonin suppression | f.lux, night mode |
| Stress/worry | Cortisol elevation | Journaling, to-do lists |

## Recovery Metrics

| Metric | Tool | Target |
|--------|------|--------|
| Sleep duration | Tracker or manual | 7-9 hours |
| Sleep quality | Subjective 1-10 | 7+ |
| HRV | Wearable | Personal baseline trend |
| Resting HR | Wearable | Stable or declining |
| Energy levels | Subjective 1-10 | 7+ |
| Soreness | Subjective 1-10 | Declining within 48h |

## Deload Week Protocol

Every 4-6 weeks, incorporate recovery week:

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Training volume | -40-50% |
| Training intensity | Maintain |
| Sleep | +30-60 min if possible |
| Nutrition | Maintain protein, slight caloric reduction |
| Stress | Minimize non-essential commitments |
| Active recovery | Increase light movement |

## Troubleshooting Sleep Issues

### Can't Fall Asleep
1. Check caffeine intake timing
2. Add evening wind-down routine
3. Try 4-7-8 breathing technique
4. Consider magnesium supplementation
5. Evaluate stress and create brain dump journal

### Waking During Night
1. Check room temperature
2. Limit fluids 2h before bed
3. Evaluate alcohol consumption
4. Check for sleep apnea symptoms
5. Consider sleep study if persistent

### Not Feeling Rested
1. Assess total sleep time
2. Check sleep consistency
3. Evaluate sleep environment
4. Track with app or wearable
5. Consider underlying health issues
