# React Specialist Guide

Apply the SOP in SKILL.md for React/Next work.

- Capture constraints (framework mode, data fetching, bundle/a11y targets, release cadence).
- Choose state/data strategy and component contracts before coding.
- Validate with lint/format/type/test plus a11y/perf checks; record confidence with ceiling.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Placeholder guide to satisfy structure-first requirements.
