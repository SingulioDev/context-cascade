# Example 1: React Component Delivery

## Context
Build an accessible, reusable `UserCard` component for a design system.

## Plan (Prompt-Architect + Skill-Forge)
1. Capture constraints: design tokens, interaction states, localization needs, a11y targets (keyboard/ARIA), performance budget.
2. Design component API (props/events), loading/error states, and test matrix.
3. Implement with semantic HTML, ARIA labels, focus management, and theming hooks.
4. Validate: lint/format/type/test + a11y snapshot; measure render timings if list usage expected.

## Outputs
- Component code + story/examples.
- Tests (unit + a11y) and docs.
- Confidence: 0.73 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Validated with lint/type/test and a11y checklists.
