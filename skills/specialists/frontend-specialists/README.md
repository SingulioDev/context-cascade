# Frontend Specialists Guide

Use this skill for frontend feature delivery, performance hardening, and accessibility improvements.

## Quick Steps
1. Collect HARD/SOFT/INFERRED constraints (framework, bundle budget, perf/a11y targets, release dates).
2. Choose architecture/state/data-fetching approach; align with design assets.
3. Implement with accessibility defaults and performance safeguards.
4. Validate: lint/format/type/test + a11y/perf checks; document confidence with ceiling.

## Guardrails
- Maintain SKILL.md, examples, tests, resources, and react-specialist docs.
- Confidence ceilings: inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95.
- MCP tags: `WHO=frontend-specialists-{session}`, `WHY=skill-execution`.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Guide aligned with refreshed SOP.
