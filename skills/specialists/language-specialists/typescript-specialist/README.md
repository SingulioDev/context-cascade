# TypeScript Specialist Guide

Operate according to SKILL.md to deliver strict, well-tested TypeScript code for browser/Node/React/Next/Nest stacks.

- Capture constraints: runtime, framework, build tools, perf/security goals.
- Enforce quality gates: type-check, lint/format, tests (unit/e2e), bundle/perf checks.
- Document env vars, scripts, and rollout/rollback.
- Report confidence with ceiling.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Placeholder to meet structure-first requirements.
