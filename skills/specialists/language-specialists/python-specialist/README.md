# Python Specialist Guide

Follow the SOP in SKILL.md for Python work (services, CLIs, tooling, ML/ops utilities).

- Capture constraints: Python version, framework, deployment target, perf/security needs.
- Apply quality gates: format/lint/type/test.
- Document assumptions, env vars, and rollout/rollback steps.
- Confidence: `X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)` required.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Placeholder guide to align structure-first requirements.
