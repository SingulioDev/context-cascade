# Language Specialists Guide

Use this skill to route language-specific work and keep Python/TypeScript playbooks healthy.

## Routing Quick Steps
1. Capture HARD/SOFT/INFERRED constraints (runtime, framework, build system, testing needs).
2. Select `python-specialist` or `typescript-specialist`; provide backup owner.
3. Share relevant examples/tests from `examples/` and ensure gaps are noted.
4. State confidence with ceiling (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95).

## Guardrails
- Maintain SKILL.md, examples, tests, resources for root and sub-skills.
- Enforce formatter/linter/test matrices per language.
- MCP tags: `WHO=language-specialists-{session}`, `WHY=skill-execution`.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Guide aligned with the refreshed SOP and routing rules.
