# Hook Creator Tests

Outline test cases for hooks: schema compliance, allow/block/modify paths, latency budgets, and rollback/registration checks. Include adversarial inputs (malformed payloads, identity failures) and record outcomes with confidence ceilings.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Placeholder to uphold structure-first guardrails.
