# System Design Architect Examples

Use these examples to demonstrate architecture patterns, tradeoff analyses, and validation plans. Align each example with the SOP: capture constraints, propose options, validate with load/failure tests, and state confidence ceilings.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Placeholder to maintain structure-first compliance.
