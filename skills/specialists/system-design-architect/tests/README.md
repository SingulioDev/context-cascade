# System Design Architect Tests

Describe validation assets for architecture outputs: load/performance test plans, chaos/failure drills, rollback rehearsals, and documentation checks. Ensure every engagement specifies which tests must pass and records outcomes with a confidence ceiling.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - Placeholder to enforce structure-first requirements.
