# Baseline Replication

Use this skill to recreate published or internal baselines before extending a method. It applies the structure-first discipline from **skill-forge** and the constraint/ceiling hygiene from **prompt-architect** so every replication is auditable and repeatable.

## Quickstart
1. Collect the source specification (paper sections, repo, configs) and capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints.
2. Mirror the environment with documented substitutions; plan seeds and metrics.
3. Run the baseline, log configs and hashes, and store outputs.
4. Validate against claimed numbers; explain any variance.
5. Package a replication report plus configs, logs, and checkpoints.

## Deliverables
- Replication report with constraint coverage and variance analysis
- Run artifacts: configs, logs, checkpoints, environment fingerprint
- Updated references/examples when new edge cases appear

Confidence: 0.83 (ceiling: research 0.85) - grounded in the SOP and expected validation steps.
