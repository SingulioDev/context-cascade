# Method Development

Design and iterate on new research methods while keeping baselines, constraints, and validation explicit. Built on skill-forge’s structure-first pattern and prompt-architect’s constraint/confidence rules.

## Quickstart
1. Capture objectives, baselines, and HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints.
2. Draft candidate approaches and map them to constraints and expected impact.
3. Plan experiments and ablations with metrics and stopping rules.
4. Run, log, and compare to baselines; analyze variance.
5. Decide to iterate, expand, or stop; package artifacts.

## Outputs
- Experiment plan and current results vs. baseline
- Ablation coverage and risk notes
- Confidence statement with explicit ceiling

Confidence: 0.80 (ceiling: research 0.85) - grounded in the documented SOP and validation.
