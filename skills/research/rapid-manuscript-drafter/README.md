# Rapid Manuscript Drafter

Produce fast, structured research manuscript drafts with explicit constraints and evidence-aware claims.

## Process
1. Capture venue rules, deadlines, and HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints.
2. Build an outline with thesis, contributions, and planned figures/tables.
3. Draft sections, tying each claim to evidence and references.
4. Validate length/style compliance and confidence ceilings; highlight gaps.
5. Package the draft with a change log and next edits.

## Deliverables
- Structured outline and current draft
- Evidence-linked claims with confidence ceilings
- Risks/gaps and next-edit checklist

Confidence: 0.79 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - grounded in the two-pass drafting and validation loop.
