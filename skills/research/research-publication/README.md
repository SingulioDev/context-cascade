Prepare submission-ready research packages with enforced venue constraints, evidence integrity, and confidence ceilings.

## Steps
1. Capture venue rules, deadlines, and HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints (policies, tone, emphasis).
2. Organize sections, figures, and tables to match the template.
3. Link claims to evidence and apply confidence ceilings; remove overclaims.
4. Complete compliance checks (ethics, licenses, reproducibility).
5. Package the submission bundle and log paths/versions.

## Deliverables
- Submission-ready manuscript and supplements
- Compliance checklist and artifacts
- Risks/reviewer considerations with confidence statement

Confidence: 0.83 (ceiling: research 0.85) - based on completed structure and evidence audits.
