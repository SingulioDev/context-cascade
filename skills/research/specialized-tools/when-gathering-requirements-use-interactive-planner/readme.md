# When Gathering Requirements, Use Interactive Planner

Lightweight router that ensures requirement-gathering requests go through the interactive-planner SOP with constraint clarity and confidence ceilings.

## How to Use
1. Confirm the task is requirement gathering; otherwise reroute to the right skill.
2. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED requirements with sources.
3. Hand off to `interactive-planner` with goals, stakeholders, and timelines.
4. Verify outputs include milestones, risks, and a confidence ceiling.
5. Store the brief and outputs for reuse.

Confidence: 0.75 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on the routing and constraint-capture steps.
