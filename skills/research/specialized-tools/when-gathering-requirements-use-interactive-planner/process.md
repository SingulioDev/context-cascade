# Interactive Requirements Planning - Detailed Process

## RESEARCH ANALYSIS GUARDRAILS

**Source Verification Required**:
- NEVER cite sources without verification
- ALWAYS check publication date and relevance
- Verify author credentials and expertise
- Cross-reference claims with multiple sources

**Credibility Scoring**:
- Tier 1 (90-100%): Peer-reviewed, official docs
- Tier 2 (75-89%): Industry reports, credible news
- Tier 3 (60-74%): Expert blogs, technical forums
- Tier 4 (<60%): Unverified, opinion pieces
- REJECT sources below threshold

**Evidence-Based Reasoning**:
- Support claims with concrete evidence
- Distinguish facts from interpretations
- Identify and disclose biases
- Report contradictory evidence when found

**Documentation Standards**:
- Provide full citations (APA, IEEE, or ACM format)
- Include access dates for web sources
- Link to primary sources when available
- Archive sources for reproducibility

## Question Flow Architecture

```
Initial Questions → Detailed Follow-up → Structure Specs → Validate → Document
```

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Discover (3-5 min)
- Ask about project goals
- Identify affected components
- Determine project type

### Phase 2: Clarify (5-10 min)
- Technical requirements
- Scale and performance
- Timeline and priorities
- Resource constraints

### Phase 3: Structure (3-5 min)
- Organize functional requirements
- Document non-functional requirements
- Define acceptance criteria
- Identify risks

### Phase 4: Validate (2-5 min)
- Review with stakeholders
- Gather feedback
- Obtain approval
- Identify gaps

### Phase 5: Document (2-5 min)
- Create specifications
- Build action plan
- Define milestones
- Allocate resources

## Memory Keys

- `requirements/initial-responses`
- `requirements/detailed-responses`
- `requirements/spec`
- `requirements/workflow-complete`

## Best Practices

1. Clear, specific questions
2. Descriptive option labels
3. Multi-select for priorities
4. Follow-up questions
5. Stakeholder validation
6. Comprehensive documentation
