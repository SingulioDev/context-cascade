# Process

1. Check fit: is the request about gathering or clarifying research requirements?
2. Bucket constraints into HARD / SOFT / INFERRED and confirm ambiguous items.
3. Invoke `interactive-planner` with the constraint set, goals, stakeholders, and timelines.
4. Validate the planner’s outputs (milestones, risks, confidence ceiling) against the captured constraints.
5. Store the brief and outputs in the project references/examples for traceability.

Confidence: 0.75 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - reflects the validated routing flow.
