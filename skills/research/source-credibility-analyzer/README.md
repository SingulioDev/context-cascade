# Source Credibility Analyzer

Evaluate whether a source is trustworthy enough for research use. Incorporates skill-forge’s structure-first expectations and prompt-architect’s constraint and confidence rules.

## Steps
1. Capture quality thresholds and HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints (recency, peer review, provenance, risk tolerance).
2. Check provenance (authors, venue, originality, recency).
3. Review methodology and data quality against the research question.
4. Analyze bias and risks (conflicts of interest, cherry-picking, missing context).
5. Score credibility with rationale and an explicit confidence ceiling; recommend use/caution/avoid.

## Outputs
- Credibility score with rationale and evidence
- Risk notes and recommendations
- Confidence statement with ceiling

Confidence: 0.82 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on the documented assessment criteria.
