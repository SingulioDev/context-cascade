# Deep Research Orchestrator

Coordinate the full research lifecycle—discovery, replication, experimentation, and productionization—with explicit quality gates and confidence ceilings.

## Use This Skill When
- Running multi-week or academic-grade research programs
- Coordinating multiple research pipelines and agents
- Needing auditable handoffs and evidence at each gate

## How It Works
1. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints plus success metrics.
2. Map pipelines (literature, replication, method dev, eval, publication) and owners.
3. Execute with two-pass refinement on every major deliverable (structure then epistemic validation).
4. Record gate evidence and adversarial checks before moving forward.
5. Package artifacts and update references/examples for reuse.

## Outputs
- Gate tracker with evidence and risks
- Links to artifacts (notes, datasets, experiments, dashboards)
- Consolidated summary with explicit confidence ceiling

Confidence: 0.80 (ceiling: research 0.85) - based on the SOP and expected validation discipline.
