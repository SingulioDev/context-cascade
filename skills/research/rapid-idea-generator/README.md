# Rapid Idea Generator

Generate and triage research ideas quickly while keeping constraints and confidence ceilings explicit.

## Steps
1. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints and success criteria.
2. Brainstorm a broad set of ideas within constraints.
3. Score each idea (impact, feasibility, novelty) with rationale and ceilings.
4. Select top candidates with next steps and risks.
5. Store the idea list for reuse.

## Outputs
- Ranked idea list with scorecards and confidence ceilings
- Shortlist with next actions and risks

Confidence: 0.77 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - grounded in the SOP and scoring rubric.
