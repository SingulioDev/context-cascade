# Researcher

Default research execution skill for scoped questions. Combines skill-forge’s structure-first requirements with prompt-architect’s constraint and confidence practices.

## Steps
1. Capture the question, decision context, and HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints.
2. Collect sources with provenance; avoid low-signal material.
3. Analyze and compare claims; note conflicts and gaps.
4. Synthesize findings to the decision need; propose follow-ups.
5. Deliver with evidence links and explicit confidence ceiling; store artifacts.

## Outputs
- Findings summary and evidence table
- Risks, gaps, and recommended next steps
- Confidence statement with ceiling

Confidence: 0.79 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on the SOP and validation checks.
