# When Verifying Quality, Use Verification Quality

Router for quality verification tasks, ensuring they run through the `verification-quality` SOP with constraint and confidence discipline.

## Steps
1. Confirm the need is quality verification/regression/readiness.
2. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints (quality bars, metrics, risk tolerance).
3. Execute `verification-quality` with metrics, thresholds, and environments.
4. Validate results with evidence and confidence ceilings; flag gaps.
5. Provide pass/block decision with risks and actions; store artifacts.

Confidence: 0.82 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on executed verification checks.
