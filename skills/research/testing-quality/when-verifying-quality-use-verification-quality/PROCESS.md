# Process

1. Verify the task is quality verification/readiness and not a narrow bug or style request.
2. Bucket constraints into HARD / SOFT / INFERRED (quality bars, metrics, risk tolerance, rollback needs).
3. Run `verification-quality` with metrics, thresholds, environments, and scope.
4. Collect results mapped to criteria with evidence and explicit confidence ceilings.
5. Provide pass/conditional/block recommendation with risks and remediation actions; store artifacts.

Confidence: 0.82 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - reflects validated verification flow.
