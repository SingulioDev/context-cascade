# When Auditing Code Style, Use Style Audit

Router for style-focused reviews that ensures the `style-audit` SOP is used with constraint and confidence discipline.

## Steps
1. Confirm the request is style/lint/readability focused.
2. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints (style guide, blockers, team preferences).
3. Run `style-audit` with code, guides, and preferences.
4. Validate findings include evidence, severity, and confidence ceilings.
5. Provide actions with owners and store artifacts.

Confidence: 0.79 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on validated style audit outputs.
