# Process

1. Confirm the task is style/lint/readability focused; reroute if functional or security.
2. Bucket constraints into HARD / SOFT / INFERRED (style guide, preferences, ownership).
3. Execute `style-audit` with code, style guides, and tooling preferences.
4. Capture findings with evidence, severity, and explicit confidence ceilings.
5. Recommend fixes with owners/dates and store outputs.

Confidence: 0.79 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - reflects validated style-audit flow.
