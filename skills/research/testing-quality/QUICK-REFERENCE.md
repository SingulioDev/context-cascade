# Quick Reference: Testing Quality (Research)

- **Purpose:** Route research artifacts to the right testing sub-skill (code review, functionality audit, verification quality, style audit, theater detection) with constraint and confidence hygiene.
- **Constraints:** capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED (coverage, latency, risk tolerance, compliance) and confirm ambiguous items.
- **Flow:**
  1. Scope & choose sub-skills.
  2. Define coverage and tools per check.
  3. Execute and collect evidence.
  4. Aggregate findings with severity and ceilings.
  5. Recommend remediation and store artifacts.
- **Output Template:** scope/constraints → selected checks → findings (evidence + severity + confidence ceiling) → actions/owners.
