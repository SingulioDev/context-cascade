# Testing Quality (Research)

Hub skill for research-focused testing sub-skills: code review, functionality audit, verification quality, style audit, and theater detection. Applies skill-forge structure-first standards and prompt-architect constraint/confidence hygiene.

## Steps
1. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED testing constraints and the artifact to validate.
2. Select applicable sub-skills and define coverage.
3. Run checks, collect evidence, and log configurations.
4. Aggregate findings with severity and explicit confidence ceilings.
5. Recommend remediation with owners and due dates; store artifacts.

## Outputs
- Consolidated testing report with evidence and ceilings
- Recommended remediation actions
- Updated references/examples for recurring patterns

Confidence: 0.81 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on executed checks and validation.
