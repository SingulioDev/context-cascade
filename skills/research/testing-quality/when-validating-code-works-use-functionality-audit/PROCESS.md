# Process

1. Confirm the task is functionality validation and identify acceptance criteria.
2. Bucket constraints into HARD / SOFT / INFERRED (coverage targets, environments, inputs, latency budgets).
3. Execute `functionality-audit` with scenarios, expected outcomes, and environment details.
4. Capture findings with repro steps, evidence, severity, and explicit confidence ceilings.
5. Recommend fixes with owners/dates and store artifacts for traceability.

Confidence: 0.81 (ceiling: observation 0.95) - reflects validated functionality-audit flow.
