# When Detecting Fake Code, Use Theater Detection

Router for suspected fake or theatrical code, ensuring the `theater-detection` SOP is used with constraint and confidence rigor.

## Steps
1. Confirm the concern is about fabricated/non-executable code.
2. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints (must-run requirements, environments, risk tolerance).
3. Run `theater-detection` with code, expectations, and environments.
4. Validate findings include repro evidence and confidence ceilings.
5. Summarize risks and actions; store outputs.

Confidence: 0.80 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on validated detection results.
