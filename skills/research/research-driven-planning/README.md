# Research-Driven Planning

Create plans anchored in evidence, constraints, and validation gates. Inherits structure-first standards from skill-forge and constraint/confidence hygiene from prompt-architect.

## Steps
1. Capture objectives, evidence on hand, and HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints.
2. Draft milestones with owners, dependencies, and checkpoints tied to evidence.
3. Stress-test against constraints, risks, and gaps; adjust sequencing.
4. Publish the plan with risks, follow-ups, and confidence ceilings.
5. Store artifacts for reuse.

## Deliverables
- Evidence-linked plan with milestones and checkpoints
- Risk/gap log with owners
- Confidence statement with explicit ceiling

Confidence: 0.80 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on validated planning against evidence and constraints.
