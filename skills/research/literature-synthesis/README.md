# Literature Synthesis

Build evidence-linked syntheses across multiple sources. The SOP uses skill-forge’s structure-first layout and prompt-architect’s constraint and confidence rules to prevent overclaiming.

## Workflow
1. Define inclusion/exclusion criteria and outputs; bucket constraints (HARD / SOFT / INFERRED).
2. Cluster sources by theme and strength.
3. Draft the synthesis with inline evidence and ceilings.
4. Run an epistemic check for conflicts, gaps, and coverage.
5. Deliver the narrative plus an evidence table and store artifacts.

## Deliverables
- Synthesized summary (bullet or narrative) with citations
- Evidence table with confidence ceilings
- Highlighted gaps/conflicts and recommended follow-ups

Confidence: 0.81 (ceiling: research 0.85) - grounded in cross-source synthesis and validation.
