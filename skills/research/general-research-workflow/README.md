# General Research Workflow

A default, two-pass research loop that frames the question, gathers evidence, synthesizes insights, and reports with explicit confidence ceilings.

## Steps
1. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints and desired deliverables.
2. Collect and screen sources with provenance.
3. Analyze and compare claims; surface conflicts and gaps.
4. Synthesize findings tied to the question and constraints.
5. Validate coverage and publish a summary with evidence and ceilings.

## Outputs
- Findings summary and evidence table
- Risks, gaps, and recommended next steps
- Stored references/examples for reuse

Confidence: 0.78 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - reflects adherence to the SOP and validation gates.
