# Research Gap Visualizer

Map what is known, where conflicts exist, and which questions remain open. Built on skill-forge’s structure-first patterns plus prompt-architect’s constraint and confidence rules.

## Steps
1. Capture topic, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints.
2. Inventory sources and claims with confidence ceilings; note conflicts.
3. Highlight gaps and weak-evidence areas; specify evidence needed.
4. Assign owners/next steps; validate against constraints.
5. Deliver the gap map and store artifacts for reuse.

## Outputs
- Coverage snapshot with evidence and conflicts
- Gap list with required evidence and owners
- Confidence statement with explicit ceiling

Confidence: 0.78 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - grounded in the current evidence inventory and validation pass.
