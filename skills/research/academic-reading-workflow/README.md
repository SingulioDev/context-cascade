# Academic Reading Workflow

A repeatable, two-pass reading system for academic papers and complex texts. It blends the structure-first discipline from **skill-forge** with the explicit constraint extraction and confidence ceilings from **prompt-architect** so every note set is searchable, sourced, and delivery-ready.

## When to Use
- Building citation-ready notes from papers or books
- Preparing evidence for literature reviews or essays
- Auditing how well a text supports a research question

## Inputs
- Source metadata (title, authors, venue/year, links)
- Research goal and deadlines
- Any preferred note schema or repository paths

## How to Run
1. Capture HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints and confirm ambiguous items.
2. Design the two passes: structural skim then evidential extraction.
3. Take tagged notes with page anchors; record confidence ceilings per claim.
4. Synthesize themes and contradictions; flag follow-ups.
5. Package outputs (notes + digest) and store with project tags for recall.

## Deliverables
- Structured Markdown annotations with keywords and page anchors
- A findings digest with open questions and risk/coverage notes
- Updated references/examples if new patterns emerge

Confidence: 0.80 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on applying the documented SOP and validation gates.
