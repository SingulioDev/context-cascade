# Interactive Planner

Run structured planning sessions that transform vague research goals into validated plans. The workflow blends skill-forge’s structure-first discipline with prompt-architect’s constraint hygiene and confidence ceilings.

## Quick Steps
1. Set the session agenda and timebox; capture participants.
2. Collect HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints with owners.
3. Draft milestones, owners, and validation checkpoints.
4. Stress-test against risks and constraints; refine.
5. Store the plan and decisions for downstream execution.

## Outputs
- Actionable plan with milestones and owners
- Risks, dependencies, and validation steps
- Confidence statement with explicit ceiling

Confidence: 0.79 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - grounded in the validated planning outcome.
