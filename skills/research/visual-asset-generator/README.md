# Visual Asset Generator

Create research visuals (figures, charts, diagrams) that faithfully represent evidence and constraints. Uses skill-forge’s structure-first discipline and prompt-architect’s constraint/confidence hygiene.

## Steps
1. Capture objectives, audience, and HARD / SOFT / INFERRED constraints (accuracy, confidentiality, formats, style).
2. Choose visual types and data mappings; plan annotations.
3. Build drafts with cited data sources and units.
4. Validate accuracy, accessibility, and constraint compliance; apply ceilings to interpretive statements.
5. Deliver assets and source files; store usage notes.

## Deliverables
- Final assets and editable source files
- Validation notes (accuracy, accessibility, constraints)
- Confidence statement with explicit ceiling

Confidence: 0.80 (ceiling: research 0.85) - based on validated visuals and evidence alignment.
