# Intent Analyzer

Disentangle user intent, constraints, and success criteria for research tasks using the two-pass refinement and confidence ceilings inspired by **prompt-architect** and the structure-first discipline from **skill-forge**.

## How to Use
1. Parse the request for verbs, objects, audience, outputs, timelines, and exclusions.
2. Bucket constraints into HARD / SOFT / INFERRED and note sources.
3. Draft the intent hypothesis with success and anti-goals.
4. Run an epistemic check, flag ambiguities, and propose clarifying questions.
5. Hand off the brief to downstream research skills.

## Outputs
- Intent hypothesis with constraint buckets
- Clarifying questions or decision points
- Confidence ceiling aligned to evidence type

Confidence: 0.76 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - based on parsed request signals.
