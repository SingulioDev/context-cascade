## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Code quality issues are detected (violations, smells, anti-patterns)
- Audit requirements mandate systematic review (compliance, release gates)
- Review needs arise (pre-merge, production hardening, refactoring preparation)
- Quality metrics indicate degradation (test coverage drop, complexity increase)
- Theater detection is needed (mock data, stubs, incomplete implementations)

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Simple formatting fixes (use linter/prettier directly)
- Non-code files (documentation, configuration without logic)
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, comment updates)
- Generated code (build artifacts, vendor dependencies)
- Third-party libraries (focus on application code)

## Success Criteria

This skill succeeds when:
- **Violations Detected**: All quality issues found with ZERO false negatives
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% (95%+ findings are genuine issues)
- **Actionable Feedback**: Every finding includes file path, line number, and fix guidance
- **Root Cause Identified**: Issues traced to underlying causes, not just symptoms
- **Fix Verification**: Proposed fixes validated against codebase constraints

## Edge Cases and Limitations

Handle these edge cases carefully:
- **Empty Files**: May trigger false positives - verify intent (stub vs intentional)
- **Generated Code**: Skip or flag as low priority (auto-generated files)
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Exclude from analysis (vendor/, node_modules/)
- **Domain-Specific Patterns**: What looks like violation may be intentional (DSLs)
- **Legacy Code**: Balance ideal standards with pragmatic technical debt management

## Quality Analysis Guardrails

CRITICAL RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW:
- **NEVER approve code without evidence**: Require actual execution, not assumptions
- **ALWAYS provide line numbers**: Every finding MUST include file:line reference
- **VALIDATE findings against multiple perspectives**: Cross-check with complementary tools
- **DISTINGUISH symptoms from root causes**: Report underlying issues, not just manifestations
- **AVOID false confidence**: Flag uncertain findings as "needs manual review"
- **PRESERVE context**: Show surrounding code (5 lines before/after minimum)
- **TRACK false positives**: Learn from mistakes to improve detection accuracy

## Evidence-Based Validation

Use multiple validation perspectives:
1. **Static Analysis**: Code structure, patterns, metrics (connascence, complexity)
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Execution behavior, test results, runtime characteristics
3. **Historical Analysis**: Git history, past bug patterns, change frequency
4. **Peer Review**: Cross-validation with other quality skills (functionality-audit, theater-detection)
5. **Domain Expertise**: Leverage .claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml if available

**Validation Threshold**: Findings require 2+ confirming signals before flagging as violations.

## Integration with Quality Pipeline

This skill integrates with:
- **Pre-Phase**: Load domain expertise (.claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml)
- **Parallel Skills**: functionality-audit, theater-detection-audit, style-audit
- **Post-Phase**: Store findings in Memory MCP with WHO/WHEN/PROJECT/WHY tags
- **Feedback Loop**: Learnings feed dogfooding-system for continuous improvement


# SOP: Dogfooding Quality Detection

**Loop 1 of 3-Part System**: Code Quality Detection → Memory Storage

**Purpose**: Automatically detect code quality violations and store findings for cross-session learning

  "INSERT INTO violations (project, timestamp, total_violations) VALUES ('<project>', '<timestamp>', <count>)"

# Trigger hook
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "qd-<timestamp>" --status "complete"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Database updated
- Dashboard refreshed
- Hook notification sent
- Ready for Phase 2 (pattern retrieval)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Code quality issues are detected (violations, smells, anti-patterns)
- Audit requirements mandate systematic review (compliance, release gates)
- Review needs arise (pre-merge, production hardening, refactoring preparation)
- Quality metrics indicate degradation (test coverage drop, complexity increase)
- Theater detection is needed (mock data, stubs, incomplete implementations)

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Simple formatting fixes (use linter/prettier directly)
- Non-code files (documentation, configuration without logic)
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, comment updates)
- Generated code (build artifacts, vendor dependencies)
- Third-party libraries (focus on application code)

## Success Criteria

This skill succeeds when:
- **Violations Detected**: All quality issues found with ZERO false negatives
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% (95%+ findings are genuine issues)
- **Actionable Feedback**: Every finding includes file path, line number, and fix guidance
- **Root Cause Identified**: Issues traced to underlying causes, not just symptoms
- **Fix Verification**: Proposed fixes validated against codebase constraints

## Edge Cases and Limitations

Handle these edge cases carefully:
- **Empty Files**: May trigger false positives - verify intent (stub vs intentional)
- **Generated Code**: Skip or flag as low priority (auto-generated files)
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Exclude from analysis (vendor/, node_modules/)
- **Domain-Specific Patterns**: What looks like violation may be intentional (DSLs)
- **Legacy Code**: Balance ideal standards with pragmatic technical debt management

## Quality Analysis Guardrails

CRITICAL RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW:
- **NEVER approve code without evidence**: Require actual execution, not assumptions
- **ALWAYS provide line numbers**: Every finding MUST include file:line reference
- **VALIDATE findings against multiple perspectives**: Cross-check with complementary tools
- **DISTINGUISH symptoms from root causes**: Report underlying issues, not just manifestations
- **AVOID false confidence**: Flag uncertain findings as "needs manual review"
- **PRESERVE context**: Show surrounding code (5 lines before/after minimum)
- **TRACK false positives**: Learn from mistakes to improve detection accuracy

## Evidence-Based Validation

Use multiple validation perspectives:
1. **Static Analysis**: Code structure, patterns, metrics (connascence, complexity)
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Execution behavior, test results, runtime characteristics
3. **Historical Analysis**: Git history, past bug patterns, change frequency
4. **Peer Review**: Cross-validation with other quality skills (functionality-audit, theater-detection)
5. **Domain Expertise**: Leverage .claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml if available

**Validation Threshold**: Findings require 2+ confirming signals before flagging as violations.

## Integration with Quality Pipeline

This skill integrates with:
- **Pre-Phase**: Load domain expertise (.claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml)
- **Parallel Skills**: functionality-audit, theater-detection-audit, style-audit
- **Post-Phase**: Store findings in Memory MCP with WHO/WHEN/PROJECT/WHY tags
- **Feedback Loop**: Learnings feed dogfooding-system for continuous improvement


## Error Handling

### If Connascence Analysis Fails:

**Agent**: `code-analyzer`

```javascript
await Task("Error Handler", `
Diagnosis:
1. Check Connascence Analyzer health
   Command: cd C:\\Users\\17175\\Desktop\\connascence && python -m mcp.cli health-check

2. Check Python environment
   Command: python --version (expected: 3.12+)

3. Check virtual environment activated
   Path: C:\\Users\\17175\\Desktop\\connascence\\venv-connascence

4. Re-run with verbose logging
   Command: python -m mcp.cli analyze-workspace <project> --verbose

If still failing:
- Store error in Memory-MCP with intent: "error-diagnosis"
- Roll back to last known good state
- Alert user with error details
`, "code-analyzer");
```

### If Memory-MCP Storage Fails:

**Agent**: `code-analyzer`

```javascript
await Task("Storage Error Handler", `
Diagnosis:
1. Verify ChromaDB accessible
   Command: python -c "from src.indexing.vector_indexer import VectorIndexer; vi = VectorIndexer(); print(vi.collection.count())"

2. Check disk space
   Command: df -h (Linux/Mac) or wmic logicaldisk get size,freespace (Windows)

3. Verify VectorIndexer.collection initialized
   Fix: Ensure VectorIndexer.__init__ calls create_collection()

4. Retry storage with exponential backoff
   Attempts: 3
   Delay: 1s, 2s, 4s

If persistent failure:
- Store analysis locally: C:\\Users\\17175\\metrics\\dogfooding\\pending\\<timestamp>.json
- Queue for retry when Memory-MCP recovers
