      "reasoning": "The skill correctly addresses the intent of creating a code formatting skill with a comprehensive structure. It includes proper YAML frontmatter metadata following Anthropic conventions, multi-language support, configuration discovery, and useful slash commands. The output is well-organized with clear tables and sections. Constraint coverage is good though no specific constraints were provided to evaluate against. VERIX compliance is moderate - the output presents claims without explicit epistemic markers or confidence levels (which is acceptable for L2 output but internal reasoning should have them). L2 purity is perfect - pure English with no VCL markers visible to user. The basic skill structure success criteria is fully met with metadata, features, and commands defined."

      "reasoning": "The skill correctly addresses the task of creating a test runner skill. It includes proper YAML frontmatter with name, description, allowed-tools (including required tools like Bash for execution), version, category, and tags. The skill covers multiple test frameworks (pytest, jest, vitest, mocha, go test) which is comprehensive. The 'When to Use' and 'When NOT to Use' sections provide clear guidance. However, the output appears truncated (cuts off mid-sentence at 'approp...'), reducing output quality score. The skill includes cognitive frames (EVD, ASP, COM) but doesn't demonstrate full VERIX epistemic notation in the body. Output is in pure English with no VCL markers visible to users. Constraint coverage is good but not all potential constraints were explicitly enumerated (e.g., CI/CD integration details, coverage thresholds). Overall a solid skill structure that meets the success criteria of being a test runner skill with tools."

      "reasoning": "The skill correctly interprets the task to create a git operations skill and places it in the tooling category as required. It provides comprehensive coverage with 10 slash commands addressing common git workflows, includes safety guarantees (force push protection, destructive command warnings), and follows proper skill structure with metadata table, features, and documentation. Output is in pure L2 English with no VCL markers visible to user. Minor deductions: output appears truncated ('toolin' at end), and while it mentions VCL v3.1.1 compliance and cognitive frames in metadata, the actual output doesn't demonstrate explicit evidential grounding or confidence markers that would indicate full VERIX compliance internally. Overall a high-quality skill specification that meets all success criteria."
