## Orchestration Skill Guidelines

### When to Use This Skill
- **Parallel multi-agent execution** requiring concurrent task processing
- **Complex implementation** with 6+ independent tasks
- **Theater-free development** requiring 0% tolerance validation
- **Dynamic agent selection** from 86+ agent registry
- **High-quality delivery** needing Byzantine consensus validation

### When NOT to Use This Skill
- **Single-agent tasks** with no parallelization benefit
- **Simple sequential work** completing in <2 hours
- **Planning phase** (use research-driven-planning first)
- **Trivial changes** to single files

### Success Criteria
- *Agent+skill matrix generated** with optimal assignments
- *Parallel execution successful** with 8.3x speedup achieved
- *Theater detection passes** with 0% theater detected
- *Integration tests pass** at 100% rate
- *All agents complete** with no orphaned workers

### Edge Cases to Handle
- **Agent failures** - Implement agent health monitoring and replacement
- **Task timeout** - Configure per-task timeout with escalation
- **Consensus failure** - Have fallback from Byzantine to weighted consensus
- **Resource exhaustion** - Limit max parallel agents, queue excess
- **Conflicting outputs** - Implement merge conflict resolution strategy

### Guardrails (NEVER Violate)
- NEVER: lose agent state** - Persist agent progress to memory continuously
- ALWAYS: track swarm health** - Monitor all agent statuses in real-time
- ALWAYS: validate consensus** - Require 4/5 agreement for theater detection
- NEVER: skip theater audit** - Zero tolerance, any theater blocks merge
- ALWAYS: cleanup workers** - Terminate agents on completion/failure

### Evidence-Based Validation
- **Check all agent statuses** - Verify each agent completed successfully
- **Validate parallel execution** - Confirm tasks ran concurrently, not sequentially
- **Measure speedup** - Calculate actual speedup vs sequential baseline
- **Audit theater detection** - Run 6-agent consensus, verify 0% detection
- **Verify integration** - Execute sandbox tests, confirm 100% pass rate

# Swarm Orchestration

## What This Skill Does

Orchestrates multi-agent swarms using agentic-flow's advanced coordination system. Supports mesh, hierarchical, and adaptive topologies with automatic task distribution, load balancing, and fault tolerance.

## Prerequisites

- agentic-flow v1.5.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Understanding of distributed systems (helpful)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize swarm
npx agentic-flow hooks swarm-init --topology mesh --max-agents 5

# Spawn agents
npx agentic-flow hooks agent-spawn --type coder
npx agentic-flow hooks agent-spawn --type tester
npx agentic-flow hooks agent-spawn --type reviewer

# Orchestrate task
npx agentic-flow hooks task-orchestrate \
  --task "Build REST API with tests" \
  --mode parallel
```

## Topology Patterns

### 1. Mesh (Peer-to-Peer)
```typescript
// Equal peers, distributed decision-making
await swarm.init({
  topology: 'mesh',
  agents: ['coder', 'tester', 'reviewer'],
  communication: 'broadcast'
});
```

### 2. Hierarchical (Queen-Worker)
```typescript
// Centralized coordination, specialized workers
await swarm.init({
  topology: '
