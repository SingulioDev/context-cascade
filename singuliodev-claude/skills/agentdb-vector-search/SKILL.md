## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Local-only operations with no vector search needs
- Simple key-value storage without semantic similarity
- Real-time streaming data without persistence requirements
- Operations that do not require embedding-based retrieval

## Success Criteria
- Vector search query latency: <10ms for 99th percentile
- Embedding generation: <100ms per document
- Index build time: <1s per 1000 vectors
- Recall@10: >0.95 for similar documents
- Database connection success rate: >99.9%
- Memory footprint: <2GB for 1M vectors with quantization

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Rate Limits**: AgentDB local instances have no rate limits; cloud deployments may vary
- **Connection Failures**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
- **Index Corruption**: Maintain backup indices; rebuild from source if corrupted
- **Memory Overflow**: Use quantization (4-bit, 8-bit) to reduce memory by 4-32x
- **Stale Embeddings**: Implement TTL-based refresh for dynamic content
- **Dimension Mismatch**: Validate embedding dimensions (384 for sentence-transformers) before insertion

## Guardrails & Safety
- NEVER: expose database connection strings in logs or error messages
- ALWAYS: validate vector dimensions before insertion
- ALWAYS: sanitize metadata to prevent injection attacks
- NEVER: store PII in vector metadata without encryption
- ALWAYS: implement access control for multi-tenant deployments
- ALWAYS: validate search results before returning to users

## Evidence-Based Validation

- Verify database health: Check connection status and index integrity
- Validate search quality: Measure recall/precision on test queries
- Monitor performance: Track query latency, throughput, and memory usage
- Test failure recovery: Simulate connection drops and index corruption
- Benchmark improvements: Compare against baseline metrics (e.g., 150x speedup claim)

# AgentDB Vector Search

## What This Skill Does

Implements vector-based semantic search using AgentDB's high-performance vector database with **150x-12,500x faster** operations than traditional solutions. Features HNSW indexing, quantization, and sub-millisecond search (<100µs).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- AgentDB v1.0.7+ (via agentic-flow or standalone)
- OpenAI API key (for embeddings) or custom embedding model

## Quick Start with CLI

### Initialize Vector Database

```bash
# Initialize with default dimensions (1536 for OpenAI ada-002)
npx agentdb@latest init ./vectors.db

# Custom dimensions for different embedding models
npx agentdb@latest init ./vectors.db --dimension 768  # sentence-transformers
npx agentdb@latest init ./vectors.db --dimension 384  # all-MiniLM-L6-v2

# Use preset configurations
npx agentdb@latest init ./vectors.db --preset small   # <10K vectors
npx agentdb@latest init ./vectors.db --preset medium  # 10K-100K vectors
npx agentdb@latest init ./vectors.db --preset large   # >100K vectors

# In-memory database for testing
npx agentdb@latest init ./vectors.db --in-memory
```

### Query Vector Database

```bash
# Basic
