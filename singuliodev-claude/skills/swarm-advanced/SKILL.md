## Orchestration Skill Guidelines

### When to Use This Skill
- **Parallel multi-agent execution** requiring concurrent task processing
- **Complex implementation** with 6+ independent tasks
- **Theater-free development** requiring 0% tolerance validation
- **Dynamic agent selection** from 86+ agent registry
- **High-quality delivery** needing Byzantine consensus validation

### When NOT to Use This Skill
- **Single-agent tasks** with no parallelization benefit
- **Simple sequential work** completing in <2 hours
- **Planning phase** (use research-driven-planning first)
- **Trivial changes** to single files

### Success Criteria
- *Agent+skill matrix generated** with optimal assignments
- *Parallel execution successful** with 8.3x speedup achieved
- *Theater detection passes** with 0% theater detected
- *Integration tests pass** at 100% rate
- *All agents complete** with no orphaned workers

### Edge Cases to Handle
- **Agent failures** - Implement agent health monitoring and replacement
- **Task timeout** - Configure per-task timeout with escalation
- **Consensus failure** - Have fallback from Byzantine to weighted consensus
- **Resource exhaustion** - Limit max parallel agents, queue excess
- **Conflicting outputs** - Implement merge conflict resolution strategy

### Guardrails (NEVER Violate)
- NEVER: lose agent state** - Persist agent progress to memory continuously
- ALWAYS: track swarm health** - Monitor all agent statuses in real-time
- ALWAYS: validate consensus** - Require 4/5 agreement for theater detection
- NEVER: skip theater audit** - Zero tolerance, any theater blocks merge
- ALWAYS: cleanup workers** - Terminate agents on completion/failure

### Evidence-Based Validation
- **Check all agent statuses** - Verify each agent completed successfully
- **Validate parallel execution** - Confirm tasks ran concurrently, not sequentially
- **Measure speedup** - Calculate actual speedup vs sequential baseline
- **Audit theater detection** - Run 6-agent consensus, verify 0% detection
- **Verify integration** - Execute sandbox tests, confirm 100% pass rate

# Advanced Swarm Orchestration

Master advanced swarm patterns for distributed research, development, and testing workflows. This skill covers comprehensive orchestration strategies using both MCP tools and CLI commands.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Claude Flow is installed
npm install -g claude-flow@alpha

# Add MCP server (if using MCP tools)
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
```

### Basic Pattern
```javascript
// 1. Initialize swarm topology
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init({ topology: "mesh", maxAgents: 6 })

// 2. Spawn specialized agents
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({ type: "researcher", name: "Agent 1" })

// 3. Orchestrate tasks
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate({ task: "...", strategy: "parallel" })
```

## Core Concepts

### Swarm Topologies

**Mesh Topology** - Peer-to-peer communication, best for research and analysis
- All agents communicate directly
- High flexibility and resilience
- Use for: Research, analysis, brainstorming

**Hierarchical Topology** - Coordinator with subordinates, best for development
- Clear command structure
- Sequ
