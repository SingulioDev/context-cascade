# SPARC Methodology - Comprehensive Development Framework

## When to Use This Skill

- **Domain-Specific Work**: Tasks requiring specialized domain knowledge
- **Complex Problems**: Multi-faceted challenges needing systematic approach
- **Best Practice Implementation**: Following industry-standard methodologies
- **Quality-Critical Work**: Production code requiring high standards
- **Team Collaboration**: Coordinated work following shared processes

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Outside Domain**: Tasks outside this skill specialty area
- **Incompatible Tech Stack**: Technologies not covered by this skill
- **Simple Tasks**: Trivial work not requiring specialized knowledge
- **Exploratory Work**: Experimental code without production requirements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Implementation complete and functional
- [ ] Tests passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Deployed or integrated successfully

## Edge Cases to Handle

- **Legacy Integration**: Working with older codebases or deprecated APIs
- **Missing Dependencies**: Unavailable libraries or external services
- **Version Conflicts**: Dependency version incompatibilities
- **Data Issues**: Malformed input or edge case data
- **Concurrency**: Race conditions or synchronization challenges
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery

## Guardrails

- **NEVER** skip testing to ship faster
- **ALWAYS** follow domain-specific best practices
- **NEVER** commit untested or broken code
- **ALWAYS** document complex logic and decisions
- **NEVER** hardcode sensitive data or credentials
- **ALWAYS** validate input and handle errors gracefully
- **NEVER** deploy without reviewing changes

## Evidence-Based Validation

- [ ] Automated tests passing
- [ ] Code linter/formatter passing
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Performance within acceptable range
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Peer review approved
- [ ] Documentation reviewed

## Overview

SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) is a systematic development methodology integrated with Claude Flow's multi-agent orchestration capabilities. It provides 17 specialized modes for comprehensive software development, from initial research through deployment and monitoring.

## Core Philosophy

SPARC methodology emphasizes:

- **Systematic Approach**: Structured phases from specification to completion
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written before implementation
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent agent coordination for 2.8-4.4x speed improvements
- **Memory Integration**: Persistent knowledge sharing across agents and sessions
- **Quality First**: Comprehensive reviews, testing, and validation
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with clear interfaces

### Key Principles

1. **Specification Before Code**: Define requirements and constraints clearly
2. **Design Before Implementation**: Plan architecture and components
3. **Tests Before Features**: Write failing tests, then make them pass
4. **Review Everything**: Code quality, security, and performance checks
5. **Document Continuously**: Maintain current documentation throughout

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Specification
**Goal**: Define requirements, constraints, and success criteria

- Requirements analysis
- User story mapping
- Constraint identification
- Success metrics definition
