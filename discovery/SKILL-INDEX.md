## Skill Invocation Pattern

```
Skill("skill-name")           // Load the SOP
    |
    v
Task("description", "prompt", "agent-type")  // Invoke agent
    |
    v
TodoWrite({ todos })          // Track progress
```

**Golden Rule:** Skills define the SOP, Agents execute it.

## Playbooks (7)

High-level workflows that chain multiple skills:

| Playbook | Skills Chained | Purpose |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| `full-feature` | intent-analyzer -> feature-dev-complete -> code-review | Complete feature |
| `research-to-code` | deep-research -> method-development -> coder | Research implementation |
| `quality-gate` | functionality-audit -> theater-detection -> security | Full quality check |

---

## Discovery Paths

- **Skill Index:** `discovery/SKILL-INDEX.md` (this file)
- **Agent Registry:** `agents/foundry/registry/registry.json`
- **Command Index:** `commands/README.md`
- **Packaged Skills:** `skills/packaged/{skill-name}.skill`
- **Raw Skill Sources:** `skills/{category}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` (used for building packaged skills)

---

## Auto-Routing

The `skill-router-hook.sh` automatically matches user requests to skills using:
1. Keyword matching against skill-index.json
2. Intent classification
3. Confidence scoring

Example:
- "build a login feature" -> `feature-dev-complete` (0.92)
- "fix the auth bug" -> `smart-bug-fix` (0.88)
- "review this PR" -> `code-review-assistant` (0.95)
